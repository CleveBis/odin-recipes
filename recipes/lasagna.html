    <h3>Crispy Cheesy Lasagna</h3>  

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
   
        <ul>1 tablespoon olive oil</ul>
        <ul>1 large onion, chopped</ul>
        <ul>3 cloves of garlic, minced</ul>
        <ul>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</ul>
        <ul>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons dried basil</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon dried oregano</ul>
        <ul>Salt and pepper, to taste</ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling: In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese, dried basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers two more times, ending with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 25-30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the lasagna is heated through. Let cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
